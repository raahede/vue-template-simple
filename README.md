# vue-template-simple
Get started working with Vue.sj without a build setup

### 1. Clone this repository

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/raahede/vue-template-simple.git
```

### 2. Run local server
You can open the `index.html` file in the browser, but then you can't use ajax requests in local development.

I recommend a module like [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server):

```zsh
npm install -g live-server # install globally
live-server # run server
```
